# Job-Search-Engine

## About

This is a single page application that allows users to enter a set of skills (e.g. "html", "css", etc.) and search for jobs that would match the skills. Each job returned can be filtered based on their minimum and maximum salaries, as well as user can choose whether to only include full time, remote only jobs or to exclude jobs with Competitive salaries. More search results can be loaded upon scrolling down the page, providing that there are more job listings that match the skills. Should there not be any jobs, the application informs the user that this is the case. Jobs are returned from various job listings sites such as Reed, LinkedIn and so on and this is facilitated by consuming the JSearch API.

In addition, thanks to the Google Maps Geocoding API and browser location features, jobs returned are within the country or region where the user is located.
